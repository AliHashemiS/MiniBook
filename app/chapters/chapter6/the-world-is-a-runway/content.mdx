Oliver took a deep breath. He was about to drop a piece from his latest digital fashion collection in key cities around the world. He knew that some of the designers and creators he admired lived in those cities. He would love for them to see his work. If enough people picked up his design and created their own spin on it, then maybe, just maybe that would make enough waves for these key players to notice him. 

Oliver put on his AR glasses, pulled up a live scene geometry of New York City, and, using his fingers, zoomed into the fashion district. Then he found an AR drop point and inserted himself into the scene. Oliver’s room turned into the skyscrapers and subway entrances. People walked around him on the sidewalk. With a double blink, Oliver started recording his scene.

“Hi everyone! I’m live in New York City– here for my latest drop. Find it, and it’s all yours. I can’t wait to see your spin on it.”

Oliver made a swiping motion, and his shirt came alive. People who were wearing their AR glasses could see him. Oliver then pulled out a shirt and threw it up in the air. It hovered there. 

“Make sure to subscribe so you can see my drops, and I can see yours!” Oliver said. Only people who subscribed to you could see your AR. Otherwise, the cloud infrastructure couldn’t handle everyone seeing every AR object. 

Oliver turned off the recording and excited the screen. He then placed drops in Tokyo, London, Paris, and Milan. Now, any time someone selected his shift, it would become an object in their inventory. They could wear it as is or adapt it to their own design and function. The dropped shirt was also linked to his digital boutique where people could shop the rest of the collection. 

Long gone were the days of creating digital clothes on a computer and uploading them to a website. Oliver worked on a 3D AR mannequin. He bought design elements and embedded features into his clothes. Using generative AI, Oliver could even design his own elements.

Sometimes, Oliver would have a dream, and, first thing in the morning, he would put his glasses on and think about the dream. The BCI in the glasses would capture the image and AI would generate it as a usable style Oliver could reuse.
