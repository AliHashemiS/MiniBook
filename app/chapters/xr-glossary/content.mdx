# XR Glossary

**AR Cloud**        
The AR cloud allows a persistent digital twin of the physical world.

**Geopose**         
Geopose is when augmented reality is defined relative to a geological reference point. Geopose and localization work together to anchor AR objects in a physical environment. 

**Localization**        
Localization is used to view AR at a specific physical spot without any special markers.

**NED (Near Eye Displays)**      
Near eye displays are the hardware that converts light on one’s pupil to show an image on the retina. 

**Nit**      
A nit is a unit of measurement that refers to the amount of light that is emitted from a surface or object.

**Occlusion**       
Occlusion is the ability to cover a virtual, augmented object with a physical one. It is what lets AR go behind a physical object.

**Open XR**     
Open XR is an initiative created by Khronos Group for a royal-free, open XR ecosystem.

**Waveguide**       
Waveguides are thin pieces of glass or plastic inside headsets like Microsoft Hololens and MagicLeap devices. Waveguides help bend and combine light into your eye. 

**XR**      
XR stands for extended reality. It’s what people use when a device doesn’t solidly fit on the VR or AR side of the spectrum. XR refers to the layers of VR, AR, and everything in between.
